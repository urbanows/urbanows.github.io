	 Another non-native species is coming
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The cactus family, Cactaceae, 
originated in the New World, remaining there until Europeans arrived and
 took specimens home.  I’ve seen them potted on windowsills from 
Slovenia to Jerusalem.  One foolish foreign introduction was to use 
pricklypear (Opuntia) for hedgerows in Australia.  Within 40 years they 
covered 100 million acres.  There were no natural enemies.  The 
Australian government then introduced the cactus moth, <em>Cactoblastis cactorum</em>,
 from Argentina, which brought the prickly pears back to 10 million 
acres.  This moth, which lays its eggs in “egg sticks” on the flat pads,
 was introduced other places for a similar purpose, including the 
Caribbean Island Nevis in 1956.  From there, it arrived in Florida by 
natural dispersal or in horticultural imports in the 1990s.  It will now
 eat its way across the southern states, spreading at an estimated 100 
miles a year.  It is projected to reach Texas in 2007, and the USDA has 
no funds to track it.  The Lepidopterists’ Society News for Spring 2004 
solicits volunteers to monitor the progress of this small, devastating 
beast.<br><br>There is little chance of any control, though The Nature 
Conservancy is attempting to protect some rare, Florida Opuntia by hand 
removing the eggs..  The cactus moth will change the Chihuahuan Desert. 
 Now, we do have some native moths that consume prickly pear.  Long ago I
 split the pad of a White Sands one for a herbarium collection and found
 a dozen white larvae alarmed at my disturbance.  These were almost 
certainly different from Cactoblastis..  While their early instars are 
white, the large, late ones are bright orange with black spots. <br><br>In
 the Chihuahuan Desert we have unleashed changes for which we have no 
idea of the outcome.  Early, heavy grazing removed grasses and disturbed
 the soil, allowing erosion and the spread of unpalatable species such 
as creosotebush, cholla, and pricklypear.  This almost certainly made a 
state change, and we will never again see the primordial landscape.  I 
am reminded of a scene in the early Mel Gibson movie Thunderdome.  The 
hero has broken out of a post-nuclear settlement in a railway 
locomotive.  Thundering across the Outback, the hero asks the locomotive
 driver, “What’s the plan?”  The driver looks astonished, replying, 
“Plan?  There ain’t no plan!”  Our desert’s future is equally obscure.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Life Finds a Way
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The sun had just risen over the 
Sacramento Mountains of New Mexicowhen my cinnamon roll made its escape.
  At least that what it looked like.  Several hundred Harvester Ants 
were under it moving slowly toward their colony, their home.  I had 
spent the night at White Sands National Monument, camped near the Alkali
 Flats, to monitor their activity.  While some scouts are out in the 
heat of the day, they swarm out at dawn.<br><br>Species of Harvester 
Ants are widespread in the dry Southwest and other countries.  They are 
famous for the severity of their bite, and are, at this moment, in a 
life and death battle with Fire Ants, as that alien species moves up the
 valley of the Rio Grande.<br><br>At White Sands in the active dunes you
 can see their scattered colonies, which are covered with small dark 
rocks.  These rocks serve to stabilize the sand of the mound, and help 
keep the colony warm.  The average deep soil temperature at White Sands 
is 60 degrees F, but a thermometer thrust in the single entrance hole 
reads about 98 F.<br><br>These ants make their living in an unusual way.
  Usually, harvester ants gather seeds, but you may have noticed there 
are few plants and seeds in the most active dunes at White Sands.  There
 are even fewer at the edge of the Alkali Flats west of these dunes. <br><br>During
 the night the entrance to a colony is guarded by a few individuals with
 their pincers held upward.  At dawn, the ants swarm out.  They forage 
for insects that settle on the sands during the cold night.  Sure, they 
will take the odd seed or cinnamon roll, but most of their diet is 
insects. <br><br>The insects are stored in chambers in the sand around 
the colony mound. In the one colony I checked, one chamber contained 
only Ladybug Beetles and one small moths called Millers. <br><br>A 
biologist often asks, “What’s the food chain, who eats who?”  In that 
barren dune field, there are many Bleached Earless Lizards.  I’ve often 
watched these small creatures lifting one foot then another off the warm
 sand between eating Harvester Ants, their main diet.  What eats the 
lizards?  I’m not sure.  I do know that Kit Fox get out there.  One 
summer I saw the tracks of a Kit Fox with a damaged right hind foot over
 an area of 20,000 acres of dunes.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Them darn ticks
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Evolution and nature care not one 
whit about our comfort, so not everything in the rich tapestry of 
ecosystems is pleasant for us.  That includes ticks.  My first encounter
 with ticks was with friends while searching for a cave near the Current
 River in Missouri.  As I pushed through heavy brush I glanced down to 
see hundreds of them crawling upwards on my Levi jacket and jeans.  We 
spent that evening in camp picking them off and popping them in a 
carbide lamp’s hot flame.<br><br>Where are ticks?  Almost everywhere, 
but especially (1) at slightly damp places with natural vegetation and 
(2) near the habitat of favorite hosts.  There are about 850 tick 
species, and the US has 82 of them.  They all live on blood.  Mammals 
are the favorite of most adults, but larval and nymph stage, especially,
 may be found on birds and reptiles as well.  Once, I was engaged in the
 grim task of shooting jackrabbits near Aden Crater for a student’s 
carrion arthropod study.  As I dropped those poor critters into plastic 
bags I saw that every big ear carried 30 or more ticks.<br><br>Ticks 
have four life stages: egg, larvae, nymph and adult.  The last three 
feed on blood.  There are two main groups, hard ticks and soft ticks.  
(What are called seed ticks are larvae.)  Mating is accomplished while 
adults are on the body of the host.  Female hard ticks mate once, lay a 
huge batch of eggs, then die.  The males die after mating.  Soft ticks 
mate and lay smaller batches of eggs several times.  Of course, ticks 
spend most of their life waiting for a host animal.<br><br>Ticks 
transmit 30 major diseases, 11 of them found in the US.  These include: 
Lyme Disease, Ehrlichiosis (with two forms caused by different bacteria 
species), Babesiosis, Tick Paralysis, Tick-borne Relapsing Fever, 
Tularemia, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Colorado Tick Fever, Masters 
Disease, and Southern Tick Associated Rash Illness.  Fortunately, 
several of these are most common in other regions and most can be 
treated with antibiotics.  However, tick paralysis is from a neurotoxin 
in the tick’s saliva.  It is considered to be a threat only to children 
among humans. <br><br>The good news from that nasty list is that the 
tick usually transmits the disease only after being attached for a day 
or more.  So, full body checks at the end of the day can really pay off.
  Also, of course, finding an engorged female tick—the size of an 
oblong, purple cherry with little, waving legs—in your hair is not a 
happy thing.  I’ve found them like that on my dog even in winter.<br><br>The usual advice includes:<br>Wear light-colored clothing to spot ticks (good around Africanized bees, also),<br>Scan clothes and any exposed skin for ticks,<br>Stay on cleared  trails,<br>Use insect repellant containing DEET,<br>Avoid sitting on the ground or on rock piles.<br><br>I’ve
 been lucky in the desert and have encountered few ticks, despite all 
those on the jackrabbits.  But be aware.  We are part of the ecosystem 
and an acceptable host to these wee creatures.<br><br>(c) William Reid<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Their mother loves them
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I stared in horror as an 8 inch 
Giant Desert Centipede (Scolopendra heros) rushed out of a crack near my
 fireplace.  Moving like an implacable monster from one of the Aliens 
movies, it rushed toward my bare feet.  (I have since read that it was 
running for cover, not attacking me.)  I danced back and ran for the 
insect spray.  A good washing in that made little change except for some
 writhing.  I was not rid of it until I picked it up with bottle tongs 
and threw it out the front door of my desert house. <br><br>Centipedes 
have a world wide distribution.  We have two centipede species here, the
 giant one--the largest centipede species--and the smaller Common Desert
 Centipede (Scolopendra polymorpha).  They have similar habits, but, the
 Giant, with dark head and tail and straw-colored segments, is more 
distinctively colored.<br><br>These incredible creatures are said to be 
entirely nocturnal, but I have seen one in the wild in daytime at 
Franklin Mountains State Park, Texas.  It was a cool, misty day, and 
their aversion to sunlight is supposed to be due to a lack of a waxy 
coat to impede water loss.  Whatever its intentions, it moved quickly 
over the gravel surface, probing into every hole it found.  They eat 
nearly any insect they find, sometimes even small lizards and mice.<br><br>If
 you see a Giant Desert Centipede, notice that the head and tail ends 
look similar.  This is purported to be an adaptation to protect them 
from predators.  If some hungry creature grabs the “head”, there’s a 
50-50 chance the real head will swing back to inject venom from a pair 
of pincer-like appendages in front of the legs.  That venom is reported 
to be very painful but not dangerous to humans.  On the tail end, also, 
are two elongated, prehensile legs apparently used to grasp prey.  
Despite anecdotal stories the other legs, one pair per segment, have 
sharp claws but no venom. <br><br>Mother centipedes take good care of 
their offspring.  They coil around the eggs and grooms them carefully.  
She does not feed during this time.  The eggs hatch in three weeks, and 
the young are only three millimeters long.  She tends them until their 
first molt about three weeks (some say a few days) later, then leaves.  
When I see these native predators—so important in our ecosystem, I am 
very glad they are only a few millimeters high at the shoulder.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 The Good People of Istanbul
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>I went to Istanbul (and Beirut) in 1958 while on leave from the army in Germany<br><br>I
 explored the great city on foot.  It's cheap and the only way to get 
the real feel of any city.  I walked the Galata Bridge and saw Topkapi 
Palace, Sancta Sophia and the Blue Mosque. <br><br>Through all this I 
wore a shapeless, black flannel suit.  I carried no camera, since it was
 my theory that you can see a place or take pictures, not both.  I had a
 crew cut getting shaggy.  My passport was at the dollar a night hotel. <br><br>But
 I was clearly not a Turk, and the mob I blundered into near a mosque 
knew it.  It was a couple hundred men, many middle-aged. and they were 
shouting something angry about America. <br><br>They crowded in close, and one put his chest against mine.  "American!" he shouted.<br><br>My
 wit, a few history classes, and a distant reading of T. E. Lawrence 
saved me.  "Deutsch!  Sprecken ze Deutsch?" I shouted back.<br><br>"German?" the man exalted in English.<br><br>I smiled broadly.  "Jawohl, Ich bin ein Deutschlander."  My accent would have gotten me jailed in Berlin.<br><br>The crowd cheered and patted me on the back and shoulders.  There's nothing like sharing a defeat to build bonds of friendship.<br><br>I
 nodded, shook hands all around and walked off in the clearest direction
 I could see.  I was soon completely lost--though still immensely 
relieved--in narrow, cart-wide streets.  Worse, the sun went down and I 
could no longer tell directions.  I wandered and wandered as the streets
 emptied of people and it grew dark.  The only light was from dim, 
second floor windows.  Either I was walking in circles, or there was no 
main street in the miles of this ancient ghetto. And I hadn’t eaten 
since breakfast.<br><br>After what seemed like hours of darkness I saw a
 lighted shop window ahead.  I rushed to it and looked in through the 
dirty window, seeing bread and sweet rolls.<br><br>I pushed the door.  
It opened slightly, releasing a puff of yeasty, hot air.  I was 
starving, and I was in a bakery!   I went in to the clanging of a large 
bell over the door.  A small, muscular man in slacks and undershirt came
 out of the back.  He wiped flour-dusted hands on an apron as he came 
with an expectant look on his face.<br><br>I smiled and pointed to the bread in the window. <br><br>A look of disgust came over his face, and he shook his head emphatically, no!<br><br>I pointed again more forcefully and reached into my pocket for coins.<br><br>He shook his head again.  No!<br><br>I
 looked pleadingly and saw comprehension come over his face.  He grabbed
 my upper, right arm with a muscular, left hand that felt like steel.  
Without a word he marched me to the back of the shop and down a narrow 
corridor.  We came into a stone-walled room with huge, brick ovens that 
may have been built in the days of the Romans.  Yellow light flickered 
from the fire pits beneath them, and two, bare light bulbs only added to
 a feeling that we were somewhere deep in the earth.  A dozen men 
silently kneaded dough and formed loaves. <br><br>The baker took a rag 
and threw open the iron door of one of the ovens.  With a long, wooden 
paddle, he reached in and brought out a flattish, braided loaf.  Smiling
 now, he held it out to me. <br><br>I juggled the hot bread for a minute, then twisted off a piece and tasted.  "Fantastic!" I said with a huge smile.<br><br>He nodded seriously and handed me the loaf.  I held out coins, and he took what may have amounted to two cents American. <br><br>Smiling
 now, he took me outside and pointed vigorously up the street the 
pointed right.  I followed the directions and found the main street I'd 
lost.  I was in bed in my hotel room in another hour.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

	 Life Finds A Way: Harvester Ants Exhibit Remarkable Adaptive Ability
	 
    </h3>
    

	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The sun had just risen over the 
Sacramento Mountains when my cinnamon roll made its escape.  At least 
that what it looked like.  Several hundred Harvester Ants were under it 
moving slowly toward their colony, their home.  I had spent the night at
 White Sands National Monument, camped near the Alkali Flats, to monitor
 their activity.  While some scouts are out in in the heat of the day, 
they swarm out in great numbers at dawn.<br><br>Species of Harvester 
Ants are widespread in the dry Southwest and other countries.  They are 
famous for the severity of their bite, and are, at this moment, in a 
life and death battle with Fire Ants, as that alien species moves up the
 valley of the Rio Grande.<br><br> At White Sands in the active dunes 
you can see their scattered colonies, which are covered with small dark 
rocks.  These rocks serve to stabilize the sand of the mound, and help 
keep the colony warm.  The average deep soil temperature at White Sands 
is 60 degrees F, but a thermometer thrust in the single entrance hole 
reads about 98 F.<br><br>These ants make their living in an unusual way.
  Usually, harvester ants gather seeds, but you may have noticed there 
are few plants and seeds in the most active dunes at White Sands.  There
 are even fewer at the edge of the Alkali Flats west of these dunes. <br><br>During
 the night the entrance to a colony is guarded by a few individuals with
 their pincers held upward.  At dawn, the ants swarm out.  They forage 
for insects that settle on the sands during the cold night.  Sure, they 
will take the odd seed or cinnamon roll, but most of their diet is 
insects. <br><br>The insects are stored in chambers in the sand around 
the colony mound. In the one colony I checked, one chamber contained 
only Ladybug Beetles and one small moths called Millers. <br>An 
biologist often asks, “What’s the food chain, who eats who?”  In that 
barren dune field, there are many Bleached Earless Lizards.  I’ve often 
watched these small creatures lifting one foot then another off the warm
 sand between eating Harvester Ants, their main diet.  What eats the 
lizards?  I’m not sure.  I do know that the Kit Fox get out there.  One 
summer I saw the tracks of a Kit Fox with a damaged right hind foot over
 an area of 20,000 acres of dunes.<br><br>(c) William Reid<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

 a Mojve rattler, a little bigger than the one that got me. Rattlesnakes
 are attacked and eaten by dozens of other creatures, and they nearly 
always match the soil around them in color.<br><br><p>It's funny in retrospect, but here's how it went down. (c) William Reid</p><p>Losing My Fear of Rattlesnakes.<br><br>Bill Reid<br><br>
            In the milliseconds before pain I felt a cool, wet mouth 
slap twice against my foot.  But I'm ahead of myself.  In meeting 
wildlife there is a difference between respect and fear.  Respect is 
what you feel when near power lines.  Fear comes when you hear a rattler
 very close.  Long ago in Colorado I heard that buzzing, looked down, 
and saw coils writhing under my running shoe.  That was horror.  Later, I
 mentally made a deal: I wouldn't bite them, and they wouldn't bite me. 
 It worked for a while<br><br>            Living in New Mexico I found 
wildlife from centipedes to bobcats.  And I saw rattlesnakes from six 
inches to six feet long.  I've never killed one because of my deal.  
Also, they're dinner for a dozen other creatures and may be central to 
our desert ecosystems.<br><br>            On an August evening, wearing 
cut-offs and flip flops, I lolled at the TV until I recalled I hadn't 
checked the horse's water.  His two acres were in back, and I reached it
 by crossing rough grass and through a gate.  I grabbed a flashlight. <br><br>
            The flashlight was weak, and the grass heads cast confusing 
shadows.  As I reached the gate, I felt two wet slaps on my left foot, 
followed by a burning pain.  I jumped back and swung the light around.  I
 saw nothing, so I pointed the light down and saw four crimson droplets 
an inch back of the toes on my left foot.  I scanned the light around 
and again saw nothing.<br><br>            A rattlesnake, I asked myself?
  Maybe it was a scorpion, a velvet ant, or one of the huge tarantulas? 
 (I'm good at denial.)  Inside, it didn't look like much, but the 
burning intensified.  I washed it, watched more blood ooze, and noticed a
 silver dollar-sized swelling.  An allergic reaction?  In ten more 
minutes my foot was rigid and numb except for the burning.  It was time 
to get help. <br><br>            I found my keys and clumped outside, 
one foot bare and one with a flip flop, and struggled into the truck.  
It took a moment to figure how to use the clutch, but I got the thing 
started and moved slowly to the gate.  There, I got out and opened the 
gate.  On the other side I went to close the gate and saw the house 
lights on and the wide open front door.  It had to be shut, and the 300 
foot walk in darkness was a long one.<br><br>            I locked up and
 started for Las Cruces.  I've got it made, I thought!  Then, a hot 
flush swept over me.  Instantly, sweat poured from my head and ran down 
my back.  It dripped from my arms onto my legs.  It slimed my hands as I
 steered the sharp turns to the highway.  Shaking began, too, and I 
tried to focus on driving.  I noticed each yard of travel over the 15 
miles to Las Cruces.  With just a little excitement, I got into the 
hospital lot and clumped my way to the E.R. <br><br>            The receptionist looked up.  "Can I help you?"<br><br>            I looked down.  My flaming-red foot was twice its usual size.  "I think a rattlesnake bit me."<br><br>
            All the usual needles went in.  Every fifteen minutes they'd
 measure my foot and write notes right on me in ball point pen.  Short 
of amputation there was no chance of losing the notes!  Two hours later,
 three small bottles added to the flow of saline from my second IV.  I 
knew I'd received tetanus and antibiotic shots, and later learned I'd 
gotten coagulants and near the max for antivenin.  My huge left foot was
 dramatically elevated on a padded rack.  The swelling reached half way 
to my knee, and it's crimson deepened to a royal purple. <br><br>       
     By then the nurse knew I was a biologist, and told snakebite 
stories each time she came by.  The most fun was her explanation of how 
surgeons will split the skin if the swelling is so great in stops 
circulation.  "You can see the muscles and tendons and blood vessels and
 everything!" she said.<br><br>            "Isn't medicine wonderful," I said, adding an ironic smile.<br><br>
            "Oh, yes, yes!" she said, glowing.  Then she looked 
disappointed.  "I don't think they'll split your leg.  The swelling is 
leveling off."<br><br>            With that, the two physicians 
returned.  The cardiologist smiled.  "The blood work came back.  It was a
 rattlesnake and he got you good!  All your platelets are destroyed.  
You blood won't clot at all.  Do you have ulcers?"<br><br>            The internist leaned closer.  "From the look of the bites I'd say you were barefoot.  Where did this happen?"<br>           <br>            "In my back yard, south of town."<br><br>
            He was incredulous.  "You walk around the desert barefoot at
 night?  Are you crazy or an idiot!"  He leaned even closer.  "I want 
your promise you'll never do that again!  You don't get a lot of chances
 with this.  You could lose a limb.  Also, many people develop a killer 
allergy to rattlesnake antivenin, and you have used up your luck!"  That
 was it, except for watching my foot turn black, and there was no tissue
 loss.  It was almost certainly a Mojave rattler, and my foot is still a
 little numb.  I'd been lucky, even if I used it all. <br><br>          
  A month later I watched a coiled Mojave rattler and a gopher snake 
near my house.  The rattler did not rattle or move from its tight coil 
as I approached.  I got a stick, kneeled, and poked it.  Nothing 
happened, so I slid the stick under and tipped it like a cow pie.  Still
 nothing. I let it down.  Again no reaction.  That snake was frozen in a
 defensive posture to prevent the gopher snake killing by constricting.<br><br>            Kneeling there, I knew, also, that I'm no longer afraid of rattlers--just very, very, very respectful.<br><br>---30--</p><p> </p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>
